# Driver-Drowsiness-Detection-System
The main idea behind this project is to develop a nonintrusive system which can detect fatigue of any human and can issue a timely warning. Drivers who do not take regular breaks when driving long distances run a high risk of becoming drowsy a state which they often fail to recognize early enough. This system will monitor the driver eyes using a camera and by developing an algorithm we can detect symptoms of driver fatigue early enough to avoid the person from sleeping.
